## Key Features

*   **Two Customizable Pens:** Go beyond the default colors! Set any color you want for two independent pens. Your choices are saved directly to your profile.
*   **Dedicated Highlighter & Eraser:** Easily mark up important concepts with a vibrant highlighter and fix mistakes with an intelligent, stroke-based eraser.
*   **Full Undo/Redo:** Never worry about a stray mark again. The eraser's actions are now fully integrated into the undo/redo history, giving you complete control.
*   **Flexible Toolbar:** Position the drawing toolbar in any corner of the screen to keep it from covering your card's content.

## My Motivation

I have been a long-time user of the incredible AnkiDraw add-on but as a student, I always felt it was missing a dedicated eraser and a highlighter for my study sessions.

So I decided to take on the challenge. With the help of AI assistance, I learned the basics of Python and add-on development to build the tool I always wanted. My goal was to create an add-on that serves every type of student from those solving complex math equations to others annotating diagrams or practicing a new language.

The Anki community has given me so much and this add-on is my little contribution back. I have put a lot of work into this and I truly hope it meets your needs.
