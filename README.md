## Key Features

*   **Two Customizable Pens:** Go beyond the default colors! Set any color you want for two independent pens. Your choices are saved directly to your profile.
*   **Dedicated Highlighter & Eraser:** Easily mark up important concepts with a vibrant highlighter and fix mistakes with an intelligent, stroke-based eraser.
*   **Full Undo/Redo:** Never worry about a stray mark again. The eraser's actions are now fully integrated into the undo/redo history, giving you complete control.
*   **Flexible Toolbar:** Position the drawing toolbar in any corner of the screen to keep it from covering your card's content.

## Update
*   **Smart Cursors:** Your mouse cursor now changes to a mini icon of your selected tool (pen, highlighter, or eraser), so you always know what tool is active.
*   **Dynamic Pen Color:** The pen cursor will now match your selected color! If you pick the red pen, your cursor turns red.
*   **Critical Bug Fix:** Fixed the frustrating bug where the pen would become unresponsive after clearing the canvas.
*   **Update now for a smoother and more intuitive drawing session!**
*   **Compact Toolbar Mode Toolbar:** There is a new option in the AnkiPenDown menu called "Use Compact Toolbar". When you enable this option, the drawing toolbar on the side of the screen shrinks. The buttons become smaller and the spacing between them is reduced.

## My Motivation

I have been a long-time user of the incredible AnkiDraw add-on but as a student, I always felt it was missing a dedicated eraser and a highlighter for my study sessions.

So I decided to take on the challenge. With the help of AI assistance, I learned the basics of Python and add-on development to build the tool I always wanted. My goal was to create an add-on that serves every type of student from those solving complex math equations to others annotating diagrams or practicing a new language.

The Anki community has given me so much and this add-on is my little contribution back. I have put a lot of work into this and I truly hope it meets your needs.
